# Hawkes Point Process

A research project that studies Hawkes point process, and how it estimates missing information using fused data.

Applicable to geospatial data, with some high dimensional data associated with one of the datasets.

First tested on synthetic data. Simulated dataset using four different settings of parameters. Fused, sampled and labelled, using the labelled points to estimate unlabelled ones. Parameters are well recovered, and unlabelled points are decently well assigned.

Then tested on real data: opioid drug overdose cases.
